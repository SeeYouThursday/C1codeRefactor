# Code Refactor

## Description

Our first homework challenge was meant to simulate a company that hired me to refactor their website for accessibility purposes. The changes will allow screenreaders to better communicate to the client the contents of the webpage. By adding semantic HTML and comments, the site's purpose is much more concise.
